## Note on Results
Depending on the search query, the results will most likely contain a few false positives (either PoCs of other CVEs or irrelevant repositories). Find-gh-poc outputs all of the query results without (currently) trying to filter them. We recommend that you use the results as a starting point and do your own filtering as you see fit for your use case.
